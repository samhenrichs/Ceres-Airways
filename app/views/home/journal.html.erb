      <h4>A journal entry from a top college student selected as an architect.</h5>
      <br>
      <p>I was selected as an engineer for the Ceres missions. In short, an asteroid the size of Texas is going to hit in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and trigger a series of earthquakes, tsunamis, and natural disasters that will lead to an on-Earth apocalypse. So we're leaving. Who's we? A group of 200 people including scientists, engineers like me, architects, and mathemeticians. Why did they choose me? I'm one of the top prospects in architecture. I went to college when I was 16, and graduated from MIT in 3 years. I went back to Harvard to get a PHD. I still can't believe they chose me. Maybe it had something to do with the bridge that I designed. I'm going to space in 100 days. I'm the only one in my family, as well as the only one that knows. They haven't told anyone yet, but I'm guessing people have gotten suspicous with the 76 probes that have been launched into the atmosphere. Those has all the liquid states of the gasses needed, some plants, food, and fuel. Next is the 25. these are the 25 people as well as countlesses plants and algaes traveling to the ISS. I'm in the ship after that. It contains the other 175 people traveling to Ceres. It's also going to have cargo. My ship, <i>Ceres III</i> launches in 100 days. I'm not sure how I feel. Grateful? Sad? Excited? Maybe all of them. I hope I don't let them down.</p>

      <p>Something bad happened. <i>Ceres-Gemini I</i> started to break down with the weight. That's why we made two ships.</p>
